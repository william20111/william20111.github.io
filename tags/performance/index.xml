      <description>Most perf settings in linux can be set from sysctl but there are a few that cant, and i would like to list a few and the best way to apply them.
On occassion i have found my rc.local script not executing with upstart on ubuntu 14.04, this can be annoying as usually its executing important performance tweaks. For example readahead on block devices or transparent pages.
sudo blockdev --setra 4096 /dev/sda  This runs to set readahead on your disks.</description>
